# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
To build a machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical transaction data.
Credit card fraud is one of the most significant issues in the finance sector. With the rise of online transactions, detecting fraudulent activities in real-time has become a challenge. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze transaction patterns and classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
